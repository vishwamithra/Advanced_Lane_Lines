# Advanced_Lane_Lines
THIS work is pertaining to Udacity's ADVANCED LANE LINES project

In this project, I used concepts related to finding lane lines and radius of curvature for curvy lane lines like color spaces, color thresholding, perspective transform, 
finding lane lines colors, gradient thresholding, histograms and sliding-window approach.

Advanced_Lane_Finding.ipynb is a jupyter notebok containing code in python 3 platform to execute the project objectives. 
write-up explains on how the project evolved. 
Folder test_images contains the test images used to perform operations like color selection, region masking, and soon
Folder test_videos contains the test videos which are used to find lane lines from each frame in the video. 
Folder test_videos_output contains video outputs after performing the above mentioned operations to detect lane lines in each frame. 


Dependencies

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

Jupyter
NumPy
moviepy

Open CV is also needed image processing.
