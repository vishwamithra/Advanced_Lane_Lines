# Advanced_Lane_Lines
THIS work is pertaining to Udacity's ADVANCED LANE LINES project

In this project, I used concepts related to finding lane lines and radius of curvature for curvy lane lines like color spaces, color thresholding, perspective transform, 
finding lane lines colors, gradient thresholding, histograms and sliding-window approach.

Advanced_Lane_Finding.ipynb is a jupyter notebok containing code in python 3 platform to execute the project objectives. 
write-up explains on how the project evolved and would be a great place to start. 

Dependencies

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

Jupyter
NumPy
moviepy

Open CV is also needed image processing.
